//! Opens a TLS connection to the configured Google IP while the TLS SNI is set
//! to `front_domain` (e.g. "www.google.com"). Inside the encrypted stream, HTTP
//! `Host` points to `script.google.com`, and we POST a JSON payload to
//! `/macros/s/{script_id}/exec`. Apps Script performs the actual upstream
//! HTTP fetch server-side and returns a JSON envelope.
//!
//! Multiplexes over HTTP/2 when the relay edge agrees via ALPN; falls back
//! to HTTP/1.1 keep-alive when h2 is refused or fails. Range-parallel
//! downloads are implemented by `relay_parallel_range_to` (writer-based,

//! buffered `relay_parallel_range` compatibility wrapper for callers that
//! want a `Vec<u8>` back.

/// * **Segment-fetch** — carries field-2 (tag `0x12`) byte-range entries

///   quality-track selectors that ask googlevideo to return a particular
///   quality track. When the player asks for *multiple* tracks at once
///   (multi-track bundling), googlevideo concatenates them into a single
///   response — easily exceeding Apps Script `UrlFetchApp`'s ~10 MB cap
///   → 502.
///
/// * **Session-init** — carries field-5 (tag `0x2a`) entries and *no*
///   field-2 entries. Field-3 here is essential session metadata
///   (language, viewer state, ...). Stripping it corrupts the init
///   handshake → CDN returns 403.
///
/// **Heuristic**:
///
/// 1. Body must be segment-fetch shape (≥ 1 field-2 entry). Otherwise
///    no-op — session-init bodies must not be touched.
/// 2. Body must carry **2 or more** field-3 entries before stripping
///    fires. The first field-3 is always kept; only the 2nd, 3rd, ...
///    are removed.
///
/// **Why keep the first field-3** (#977, unacoder testing, May 2026):
/// the original "strip all field-3" rule produced empty googlevideo
/// responses on single-track requests — the player asks for ONE track
/// via a sole field-3, we strip it, and the CDN answers a request with
/// zero tracks selected by sending nothing. The player retries
/// indefinitely with the `rn=` retry counter incrementing, never
/// advancing its buffer. Keeping the first field-3 means single-track
/// requests pass through unchanged (no regression at low quality)
/// while multi-track requests still get capped to one track (the
/// 10 MB-blowup fix is preserved).
///
/// Only top-level fields are inspected; nested messages are left intact.
/// On a malformed body (truncated tag, unknown wire type) the unparsed
/// tail is appended verbatim so a corrupt request is never silently

//! TLS-fragmentation Direct Mode for Google-owned domains.
//!
//! Ported from zyrln (https://github.com/ajavadinezhad/zyrln) — Go original
//! at `relay/core/{fragment,direct,direct_profiles}.go`. The idea: for
//! Google-served domains, skip both Apps Script relay and the SNI-rewrite
//! MITM path entirely. Instead, dial straight to a Google front IP and
//! pass the browser's *real* TLS ClientHello through, split across N TCP
//! segments with inter-chunk delays. DPI engines that need to reassemble
//! the SNI in a single packet can't catch it; once past the handshake,
//! Google routes by the encrypted Host (HTTP/2) or SNI as usual, so the
//! browser ends up with a real TLS session to the real origin.
//!
//! Compared to `do_sni_rewrite_tunnel_from_tcp`, this path needs **no
//! MITM CA install** — that's the main UX win on top of bypassing the
//! relay's quota.
//!
//! Failure model: TLS-handshake-level. We don't commit on TCP-connect
//! alone — TCP succeeds even when DPI is going to RST the handshake a
//! few hundred ms later. Instead, every dial path writes the
//! ClientHello fragmented and then *waits for the upstream to send
//! bytes* (the TLS ServerHello) within a short window. Only profiles
//! that actually elicit a ServerHello are accepted as winners; the
//! race re-runs over remaining profiles when the first one doesn't.
//! When every profile fails, we hand a `PrefacedTcpStream`-wrapped
//! client socket back to the dispatcher with the buffered ClientHello
//! as a preface so the existing SNI-rewrite tunnel can re-accept the
//! same ClientHello bytes. zyrln stops at TCP commit; this implementation
//! adds the validation step and the fallback wrap.

// just "send the real ClientHello to the real server, split across
// TCP segments, see if DPI lets it through."
//
// Last-winner is a single process-global AtomicUsize indexing into
// PROFILES. Most DPI engines treat all destinations the same, so once
// we find a profile that works for one host the others usually agree.
// No per-host cache (would balloon to thousands of entries on a heavy
// device), no disk persistence (cheap to re-race once after restart).

/// — bad latency and a real battery drain on Android. With the
/// breaker tripped for that specific host, the dialer skips
/// fragmentation entirely and goes straight to raw fallback (one
/// ~5 s TCP connect that likely fails too). Net result on a
/// fully-blocked destination: ~6 s saved per connection during the
/// cooldown window, without contaminating other hosts.
///
/// Threshold + cooldown tuning is deliberately gentler than the

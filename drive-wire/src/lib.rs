//! Wire format types for the Drive-mailbox transport.

//! Two layers live here:
//! - [`frame`] — binary-packed `WireFrame` (the encrypted payload
//!   body uploaded to / downloaded from Drive).
//! - [`filename`] — direction-prefixed Drive filename grammar
//!   (`h_<sid>_0`, `c2r_<sid>_<seq>`, `r2c_<sid>_<seq>`).
//!
//! Path-depended by both the rahgozar client (`src/drive_client.rs`)
//! and the `rahgozar-drive-relay` binary so the two cannot drift.

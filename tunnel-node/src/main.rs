//! HTTP Tunnel Node for MasterHttpRelayVPN "full" mode.
//!
//! Bridges HTTP tunnel requests (from Apps Script) to real TCP connections.
//! Supports both single-op (`POST /tunnel`) and batch (`POST /tunnel/batch`)
//! modes. Batch mode processes all active sessions in one HTTP round trip,
//! dramatically reducing the number of Apps Script calls.
//!
//! Env vars:
//!   TUNNEL_AUTH_KEY — shared secret (required)
//!   PORT           — listen port (default 8080, Cloud Run sets this)

/// **This is a knob, not a constant of nature.** It trades push latency

///
/// **History:** the pre-pipelining tunnel-client was strictly serial
/// (one in-flight op per session). Holding the poll for 15 s was the
/// sweet spot — long enough that Telegram XMPP / Google Push didn't
/// interpret frequent empty returns as connection instability and
/// rotate sessions (which each cost a 4 s TLS handshake through Apps
/// Script), short enough to fit inside the client's 30 s `BATCH_TIMEOUT`.
///
/// The pipelining redesign (upstream PR #1115) changed the trade-off
/// shape entirely. Each session now keeps `INFLIGHT_OPTIMIST` (=3) to
/// `INFLIGHT_ACTIVE` (=6) batches in flight at once, so a poll resolving
/// at 4 s is invisible to the client: a sibling slot is still holding
/// the channel open and will collect any push data the moment it
/// arrives. The Telegram-stability concern that motivated 15 s no longer
/// applies — there is always at least one other slot in flight to
/// absorb push within ≤ 4 s. The 4 s value also gives the pipeline's
/// adaptive-depth controller faster feedback for ramp-down on idle.
///
/// Quota note (honest version): even at the `INFLIGHT_IDLE = 1` floor,
/// one idle session still cycles roughly every 5 s (4 s long-poll +
/// ~1 s refill stagger), or ~12 polls/min. The old serial design at
/// 15 s cycled every ~16 s — ~3.75 polls/min. Idle sessions cost about
/// 3× more polls under the pipelined defaults; that's amortized by the
/// throughput win on active sessions and by users typically having far
/// fewer idle sessions than active ones, but it IS a measurable
/// quota-rate increase. If a future deployment needs to clamp idle

// Connect-path acceleration: DNS cache + idle TCP pool + hot-host tracker.

// Profiling on a typical session-open showed two real costs that compound
// across a multi-RTT TLS handshake against PSN/Akamai:
//   1) `TcpStream::connect(host:port)` does DNS resolution inline, which
//      adds 5-30 ms per uncached resolve from a non-local resolver.
//   2) The TCP three-way handshake to a far CDN edge adds 30-100 ms.
//
// `PrewarmState` caches both. The DNS cache is a straightforward
// host:port -> Vec<SocketAddr> map with a short TTL. The TCP pool keeps
// a small number of idle connections per hot host. "Hot" is defined
// as ≥ HOT_HOST_MIN_COUNT connects within HOT_HOST_WINDOW; this keeps
// the pool from filling up with one-off destinations and bounds the
// FD overhead on the tunnel-node.
//
// Pool entries are deliberately short-TTL (`TCP_POOL_TTL`) so we don't
// hand out connections an intermediary might have ghosted while idle,
// and `open_tcp` does a non-blocking `try_read` liveness check (see
// `is_likely_alive`) on every pool entry before handing it to a session;
// entries that fail the check are discarded and `connect_fresh` runs
// instead. Race-window stragglers (peer closed but the FIN hasn't
// propagated yet) can still slip through; the cost is one wasted
